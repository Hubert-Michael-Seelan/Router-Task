      <h4>Website Development</h4>

      <p>
      In the website industry, web development tends to be classified as the coding and writing of the HTML or source code – rather than the creation of the look and feel of the website.

Our web development team looks beyond the visual effect of the website and takes other factors into consideration such as the user-friendliness of the website, ease of maintenance and adhering to the best practices and website development standards. We also take into account the search engine friendliness and optimisation of the website – and of course, we make sure that the website serves and meets its main objectives. 

Content Management System (CMS)
For over a decade, our focus has been on the development and refining of a reusable software framework that is easy to use, reliable and easily updated. In the world of web development, this is referred to as a Content Management System, or CMS, and it complements a website by providing webmasters and website owners with the tools to manage their website’s content themselves. The CMS makes it easy for the webmaster to manage the website’s navigation, SEO, content and other assets such as images and videos.

For us, owning the framework means that we can develop websites around our customer’s unique requirements and ensures not only improved security, but also a quicker turnaround when updating, enhancing or debugging the websites. 

E-Business and Systems Integration
E-Business allows companies to link their internal and external processes effectively and efficiently. They also work closely with suppliers, customers and partners to better satisfy their needs and expectations – leading to improvements in overall business performance.
